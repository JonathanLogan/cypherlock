// +build windows

// Package windows contains an interface to the low-level operating system
// primitives. OS details vary depending on the underlying system, and
// by default, godoc will display the OS-specific documentation for the current
// system. If you want godoc to display syscall documentation for another
// system, set $GOOS and $GOARCH to the desired system. For example, if
// you want to view documentation for freebsd/arm on linux/amd64, set $GOOS
// to freebsd and $GOARCH to arm.
//
// The primary use of this package is inside other packages that provide a more
// portable interface to the system, such as "os", "time" and "net".  Use
// those packages rather than this one if you can.
//
// For details of the functions and data types in this package consult
// the manuals for the appropriate operating system.
//
// These calls return err == nil to indicate success; otherwise
// err represents an operating system error describing the failure and
// holds a value of type syscall.Errno.
